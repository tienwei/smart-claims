## Overview

In this workshop you will create a skill called The Foodie that recommends a meal. When launched, this Alexa Skill will prompt the user for the information it needs to recommend a meal. Once all of the required information
is collected, it will send the data to an external web service which processes
the data and returns meal recommendations. The user can decide if they want to cook, eat our or in.

To learn more about this skill and about conversational design, visit the [Designing for Conversation](https://alexa.design/4conversation) companion course.

Through this workshop, you'll learn how to use advanced Alexa Skills Kit
features to create and configure an Alexa Skill and AWS Lambda. The features you'll
learn to use are Dialog Management and Entity Resolution. These features leverage
Alexa's Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language Understanding (NLU),
and Machine Learning (ML), which makes your life easier because you don't have
to write code. You only need to provide training data to the Alexa engines via your
interaction model. The skill builder makes it easy to do so.
